# Known bugs
- Discord loves to be a pain and one of these pains is with the rpc not updating. If this happens then restart discord and it should fix itself.
- Discord also loves ratelimits, if you change your rpc to often you will get a "Connection closed" issue. Just wait a bit then retry and it should start working again.
